# Cyber-Security-Incident-Responses

# About the Project

This project involves creating three business intelligence (BI) dashboards for a hypothetical organization to monitor and manage cybersecurity incidents. The dashboards are tailored to different audiences such as the management team, the response team, and the cybersecurity analyst.
<br>
**The management dashboard**

The management dashboard enables the management to
- monitor employee performance over a selected time period 
- Identify incident trends over a selected time period 
- Assess financial impact

<br>

Further, the dashboard can be used to filter by each employee to 
- identify how fast they have reacted and closed an incident
- Assess KPI metrics
- identify employee strengths and weaknesses when handling incidents

<br>
Example, when comparing Zoe Blackwood and Liam Jone, 

- Zoe reacts faster for an incident than Liam and meets her KPI
- Zoe has room for improvement in handling hacking incidents 
- Liam has room for improvement in phishing attacks

<br>

**The Analyst dashboard**

This dashboard is designed to provide a more detailed view for the cyber security analyst. The dashboard is capable of the following.

- Analyze incident trends by count and severity over time
- Identify the average response time and close time by attack type to monitor effectiveness of employee training over time
- Identify and analyze financial loss by each type of incident

<br>


Further, the dashboard can be filtered by severity of an incident or by employee or both for further insights.

<br>


**The incident response dashboard**
<br>

The incident response dashboard is designed to provide an overview of real time information for the incident response team or team leadership. 
The dashboard will be used for the following

- To identify how many incidents are active, resolved and not assigned in a given time
- To identify team member availability and workload in a given time

This dashboard can also be filtered by severity of an event as well as by each team member or timeframe.
